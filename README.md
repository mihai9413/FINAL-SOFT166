# SOFT166 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND SCREENSHOTS


## DESCRIPTION
My website has 4 pages. Throughout the website, I have created a clear navigation bar that sits on the left side of the screen. The first page is the index page. From here you can click a button to go to the main application page. You can also read some brief instructions on how to play the game. Also a picture of the game is displayed. All these features are programmed using <div> tag and CSS styling. 
My second page is my main application page. From here you can play a Simon Says memory game using the lights on the wall in SMB109. Click start to play the game, a random colour will flash. If you click the correct button, another random colour will flash. You must remember the sequence as it gets longer and longer. Whichever colour flashes on the screen, will also flash on the lights.
My third page is an about page. Here is a short description on my project and the website. I also link my github and trello board. 
My final page is a light switch application. From here you can turn the lights on with a specific colour. You can also turn the lights off, individually or all together and turn all the lights on.
